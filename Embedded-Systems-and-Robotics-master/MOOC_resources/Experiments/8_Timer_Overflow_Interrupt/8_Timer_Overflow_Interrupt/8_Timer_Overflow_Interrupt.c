	Q: Why do we select the division factor of 1024 such that the Timer / Counter 4 uses the clock of F_CPU / 1024 ?
	
	Ans: The crystal frequency or system clock ( F_CPU ) connected to ATmega2560 on Firebird V robot is 14.7456 MHz or 14745600 Hz.
		 Timer 4 is of 16-bit meaning it will count from 0 up to maximum of 65535, in total 65536 clock pulses. So, the maximum delay a timer
		 can produce = 65536 x ( 1 / 14745600 ) = 4.44 milliseconds. Since we want to create a delay of minimum 1 second, we have to increase the time
		 period of one clock pulse, which means the clock provided to Timer 4 should be decreased. This can be achieved with the help of prescaler.
		 So, if we choose the division factor of 1024 from prescaler, the clock for Timer 4 = ( F_CPU / 1024 ) = ( 14745600 / 1024 ) = 14400 Hz.
		 Hence, the maximum delay Timer 4 can now produce = 65536 x ( 1 / 14400 ) = 4.5511 seconds. This is enough for the application at our hand since
		 we just have to create delay of 1 second.
