# Introduction
Crash Course is an online platform developed by e-Yantra, to offer Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) for individuals from varying backgrounds. We encourage students in Engineering/ Science/ Polytechnic colleges to take advantage of the courses.

Our 4 Weeks Course is offered along with a challenge activity to help you hone your acquired skills. This is like a “mini-theme” of our popular e-Yantra Robotics Competition.
